Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Gameplay Programmer position at Embark. As someone who has always been fascinated by the art and science of creating games, I’m eager to bring my technical skills, creativity, and enthusiasm to your incredible team. Let’s just say, making games at Embark would be a legendary achievement unlocked for me.

I was born in Equator but I grew up in Spain, so I have always been sorounded by people from various cultures, and it would be exciting for me to be part of a international team.

My love affair with creating things began as a child when I discovered the magical world of animation. Using Pivot Animator and Adobe Flash, I crafted short, silly stories about my friends, which they found utterly hilarious (or so they told me—I’m sure their laughter was entirely genuine). This sparked an insatiable curiosity about how games and animations are made, leading me to experiment with programming. During my bachelor's degree, I proudly created a tile-based game using Java’s Swing library. It wasn’t Fortnite, mind you, but it worked and didn’t crash too often, which I considered a triumph.


Recently, I completed a one-year specialization course in video game development, where I expanded my knowledge of modern game design techniques and tools. Today, I spend much of my free time working with Unreal Engine, creating games for jams, hackathons, or just for fun. Occasionally, I even revisit my animation roots with Blender—though my characters still sometimes move like NPCs with bad pathfinding.


Embark has been a massive inspiration to me. Whether it’s the groundbreaking gameplay of The Finals, your work has redefined what games can be. Joining your team would not only be a dream come true, it would probably leave me doing a celebratory emote for weeks. Also I'm so curious about the AngelScript language and I would love to give it a try.


While I’ve built a strong foundation in programming, I’m eager to learn more about the collaborative processes, tools, and techniques that bring AAA games to life. I’m ready to level up with the guidance of a mentor and to contribute my energy and creativity to support the team in making exceptional products.


Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can support Embark.


Sincerely,
Jose Alejandro Zaquinaula Ramón
