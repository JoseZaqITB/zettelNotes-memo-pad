Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the summer kingternship. As someone who has always been fascinated by the art and science of creating games, I’m eager to bring my technical skills, creativity, and enthusiasm to your incredible team. Let’s just say, making games at King would be a legendary achievement unlocked for me.

I was born in Equator but I grew up in Spain, so I have always been sorounded by people from various cultures, and it would be exciting for me to be part of a international and dynamic team where I can contribute my skills while learning how large-scale games are developed and delivered to millions of players.

My love affair with creating things began as a child when I discovered the magical world of animation. Using Pivot Animator and Adobe Flash, I crafted short, silly stories about my friends, which they found utterly hilarious (or so they told me—I’m sure their laughter was entirely genuine). This sparked an insatiable curiosity about how games and animations are made, leading me to experiment with programming. During my bachelor's degree, I proudly created a tile-based game using Java’s Swing library. It wasn’t Candy Crush, mind you, but it worked and didn’t crash too often, which I considered a triumph.


Recently, I completed a one-year specialization course in video game development, where I expanded my knowledge of modern game design techniques and tools. Today, I spend much of my free time working with engines, creating games for jams, hackathons, or just for fun. Occasionally, I even revisit my animation roots with Blender—though my characters still sometimes move like NPCs with bad pathfinding.

My experience spans across multiple areas of software development, making it difficult to choose a single role. I have collaborated with design teams as a front-end developer, worked on game engines, and enjoyed investigating and implementing new features. Whether optimizing a system, designing a UI, or researching better algorithms, I love the problem-solving aspect of development. The idea of working in Innovation and Development excites me—it seems like an environment where creativity and technical expertise are truly valued.

I have developed a strong adaptability to new technologies, frequently switching between programming languages (Java, Kotlin, Python, JavaScript, C++, C#) and frameworks (React, React Native, Expo) as needed. My background includes experience in data structures, algorithms, software paradigms, and writing clean, maintainable code. I’ve also worked across platforms, moving from Android-specific development to cross-platform apps, and from front-end web design to supporting backend API development.

Beyond coding, I take pride in my organizational skills, utilizing tools like Notion, Trello, and Zettelkasten for efficient task management. Most importantly, I enjoy working in teams, meeting new people, and sharing ideas. Being surrounded by passionate developers in a big company would be an incredible opportunity to grow and contribute.

King has been a massive inspiration to me. Whether it’s the groundbreaking gameplay of Candy Crush, your work has redefined what games can be. Joining your team would leave me doing a celebratory emote for weeks. Also I'm so curious about the languages and engines you use and I would love to give them a try. Also internet has told me that King is renowned for its vibrant culture that blends creativity, passion, and collaboration, and I would love to be in a environment that fosters innovation and rewards creativity, making it an ideal place for individuals like me eager to contribute to groundbreaking projects.


While I’ve built a strong foundation in programming, I’m eager to learn more about the collaborative processes, tools, and techniques that bring AAA games to life. I’m ready to level up with the guidance of a mentor and to contribute my energy and creativity to support the team in making exceptional products.


Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can support King.


Sincerely,
Jose Alejandro Zaquinaula Ramón
