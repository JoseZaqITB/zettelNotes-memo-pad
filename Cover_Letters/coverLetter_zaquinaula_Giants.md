Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Junior Gameplay Programmer position at Giants. As someone who has always been fascinated by the art and science of creating games, I’m eager to bring my technical skills, creativity, and enthusiasm to your incredible team. Let’s just say, making games at Giants would be a legendary achievement unlocked for me.

My love affair with creating things began as a child when I discovered the magical world of animation. Using Pivot Animator and Adobe Flash, I crafted short, silly stories about my friends, which they found utterly hilarious (or so they told me—I’m sure their laughter was entirely genuine). This sparked an insatiable curiosity about how games and animations are made, leading me to experiment with programming. During my bachelor's degree, I proudly created a tile-based game using Java’s Swing library. It wasn’t Farming Simulator, mind you, but it worked—and didn’t crash too often, which I considered a triumph.

Recently, I completed a one-year specialization course in video game development, where I expanded my knowledge of modern game design techniques and tools. Today, I spend much of my free time working with Unreal Engine, creating games for jams, hackathons, or just for fun. Also, I'm reading books about best practices on programming as Clean Code or Pragmatic Programmer with the purpose to write good code. 

While I have not yet worked directly with Lua, my extensive experience in Python, C#, Java  and JavaScript has equipped me with a strong understanding of programming fundamentals, such as object-oriented programming, data structures or best practices. For example, I recently learned Blueprint within a short timeframe to successfully deliver a unreal engien videogame. I am confident this adaptability will allow me to quickly become proficient in Lua and contribute effectively to your team.

Giants has been a massive inspiration to me. Joining your team would not only be a dream come true, it would probably leave me doing a celebratory emote for weeks. 

While I’ve built a strong foundation in programming, I’m eager to learn more about the collaborative processes, tools, and techniques that bring AAA games to life. I’m ready to level up with the guidance of a mentor and to contribute my energy and creativity to support the team in making exceptional products.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can support Giants.

Sincerely,
Jose Alejandro Zaquinaula Ramón
