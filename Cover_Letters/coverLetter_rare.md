Dear Hiring Manager
I'm eager to get involved in the game industry world, I'm recently finished a one year course about videogames and enjoy a lot all the knowledge.

For a programmer there are different branches to specialize, webs, apps, systems, network, cyber security, videogames and perhaps others I may not know, and I feel videogames is the one for me.

Since I was a child I was doing animations, telling stories about my friends, then showing them and  see them laugh. I had to research a lot to get to know how a animation is done, then I find pivot Animator, then trying to improve I discover Adobe flash.
Then I tried to make videogames, using the same Adobe flash and its ActionScript programming language, but it was difficult in that time for me and left it there. So once I entered in the programming world, I made very primitive games with the Linux terminal, and then try the  GUI java library call Swing with which I made a project to create a tile-base graphics game. I get excited with that project.

So now in my free time , once in a while I make animations with blender, and using more time making  games in  Unreal Engine and Unity, whether it is for a jam, hackaton or just for fun.

Rare is a big company that I really appreciate, it have made amazing videogames like donkey Kong ( who makes me have great times with my cousin ) or Everwild and for me it's an honor to work in Epic Games.

I have good technical skills but I don't know how to make a very good videogame or how it is to be part of it or what kind of process or  methods to use. I would like to have a mentor that guides me in my first steps in the industry and learn about all the programming roles, and of course to make all the effort to make good products and support the company.

Thanks for giving me your time.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the programmer internship position at Rare. As someone deeply passionate about the gaming industry, I recently completed a one-year specialization course in video game development, which greatly expanded my knowledge and inspired me to pursue this path professionally.

As a programmer, I explored various fields such as web development, app creation, systems programming, and cybersecurity during my education. However, it was clear from the start that video games were the perfect blend of creativity and technical challenge for me.

My passion for creating experiences began in childhood when I made animations and stories about my friends which were wildly entertaining(or at least that’s what their polite laughter suggested). I started with Pivot Animator, then Adobe Flash, where I also experimented with ActionScript to create simple games. Later, during my bachelor’s degree, I ventured further into programming, making primitive games with the Linux terminal and a tile-based graphics game using Java’s Swing library. That project in particular sparked a lasting excitement for game development.

These days, I spend my free time creating games in Unreal Engine and Unity, whether for jams, hackathons, or personal projects. Occasionally, I also use Blender to create animations, rekindling my love for storytelling in visual form.

Rare has always been a company I deeply admire. Its legacy of creating memorable experiences like Donkey Kong—a game that gave me countless joyful moments with my cousin—and the visually stunning Everwild inspires me. Joining your team would be an incredible honor.

While I have built a strong technical foundation, I am eager to learn the collaborative processes, tools, and methodologies used in professional game development. I would greatly value the opportunity to work with experienced mentors, contribute meaningfully to your projects, and support Rare’s mission to create unforgettable games.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can grow with Rare and contribute to its creative vision.



Sincerely,
José Alejandro Zaquinaula Ramon
