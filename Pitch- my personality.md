title: Pitch- my personality 
---
I'm a person with the desire to be useful for the world, I don't like to do nothing or do things that doesn't give nothing to noone, or worse make something design for bad purposes.

I don't really care bout paychecks, I have a minimalist life but I prefer to receiver what my works deserve, and have no privileges, receive and be equal to the others.

I'm a creative and passionate person, I have been traingin my creativity muscle since my childhood where one of the things I did was a series of video animation telling my own stories and showing it to my friends.

I love knowledge and technology something I discover during my time in the university, so my Carrera fits with me because o always learn something new every day.

Everytime a good idea comes out of my mind y try to build it. 

Right now I am searching for a cause to be committed. I wanna be part of a team that has something to make in this world.

And finally, someday I will help to the worlds, focusing in supporting the life and the planet, maybe a voluntering or a public service.
