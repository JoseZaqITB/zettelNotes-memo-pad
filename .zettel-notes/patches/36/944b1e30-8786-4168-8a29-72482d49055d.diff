-I'm eager to get involved in the game industry world, I'm recently finished a one year course about videogames. There are web, app, systems, network, cyber security, videogames and others I may not know. And I feel videogames is the one for me. Since I was a child I was doing animations, telling stories about my friends just for see them laugh. Then I tried to make videogames, with Adobe flash, but was difficult in that time for me. Now in my free time, after entering in the programming world, I've made animations with blender, and a few games in Java, Js and  Unreal Engine.
