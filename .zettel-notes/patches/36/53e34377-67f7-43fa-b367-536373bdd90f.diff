+I'm eager to get involved in the game industry world, I'm recently finished a one year course about videogames. There are web, app, systems, network, cyber security, videogames and others I may not know. And I feel videogames is the one for me. Since a child I was doing animations, telling stories about my friends just for see him laugh. Then I tried to make videogames with Adobe flash but I  knew nothing about programming in that moment. So this industry is familiar for me.
