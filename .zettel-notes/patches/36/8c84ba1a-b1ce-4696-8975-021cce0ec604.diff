-I am writing to express my deepest, most unbridled enthusiasm for the Internship Programmer position at Epic Games. In fact, if enthusiasm were a currency, I’d have enough to buy all the V-Bucks in the multiverse. Unfortunately, it isn’t, so here I am, hoping you’ll accept this humble letter as legal tender instead.

-More recently, I completed a one-year specialization in video game development, where I delved into modern tools and practices. These days, you’ll often find me tinkering away in Unreal Engine, creating games for jams, hackathons, or simply to satisfy my innate need to see things explode in aesthetically pleasing ways. Occasionally, I dabble in Blender animations, though I’ll admit my characters still sometimes move like they’ve had one too many cups of tea.

-Now, let’s talk about Epic Games. Your titles like Fortnite and the Gears of War franchise have redefined the industry, leaving a trail of dropped jaws and sweaty palms in their wake. Joining your team would be a tremendous honor—and possibly the best excuse I’ll ever have to tell people at parties, “Yes, I work at Epic. No, I can’t get you free skins.”
+Epic Games has been a massive inspiration to me. Whether it’s the groundbreaking gameplay of Fortnite or the action-packed brilliance of the Gears of War franchise, your work has redefined what games can be.

-While I have a strong programming foundation, I know there’s much more to learn. I’m keen to gain firsthand experience in the game development process, from scripting to collaborative workflows, all under the guidance of industry veterans. With my enthusiasm, creativity, and willingness to ask ridiculous questions (but only occasionally), I am confident I can make meaningful contributions to your team.
+While I’ve built a strong foundation in programming, I’m eager to learn more about the collaborative processes, tools, and techniques that bring AAA games to life.

-Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can support Epic Games—and, dare I say, bring just a touch of silliness and charm to the process. After all, every team could use a programmer who knows their way around a punchline as well as a punchcard.
