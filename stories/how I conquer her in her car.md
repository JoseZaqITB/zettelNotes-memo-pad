# The way I decler to her in her car
Vero and I was going back to the rooms in her car after having a couple of beers with sergio and other friends. We were having a good time on the route to the rooms, talking a lot, good mood and confidence in the air. At some point the talk finish and I see a perfect moment to tell her the way I see her.
Jose: haha pinche Vero, u know what? I'm gonna tell u a secret
Vero: OK, tell me
Jose: I like you, you seems very pretty and interesting, you look very well, are mature, I like your string and the most important thing... U have a car.
Vero: haha thank u
Jose: with the car everyone falls in love with you
Vero: yeah, that's why my ex fall in love
Jose: haha it's powerful, maybe a have to buy some car.
Vero: be careful, because u could've have u wtsapp full after that.
Jose: I'm gonna ake the risk... 

At this point we have arrived to the parking lot near my room and she has stop the car for me to go. 

Jose: well, anyway don't worry i don't gonna do nothing with this feeling... Because for u misfortune I want a girl-friend more than a girlfriend...i mean I need it. 
Vero: really? That's bad, u like me too... 
Jose: what?! You mean it?? Ok let me see (I grab her hand simulating that i see in the hand if she is telling the true or not) 
No way, u are serious. 
But why? Are u crazy? 
Vero: haha why u say that? U are pretty too. 
Jose: because I literally didnt do nothing to make you fell in love with me. I treat u as a friend a the whole time and I didn't use my powerfull seductive methods.. I didn't know that that works. 
Vero: yeah I am a little crazy I think. 
Jose: well, take back what u said, I get exicted swiftly...im just, I'm just have to forget this conversation to avoid do stupid romantic stuff. 
Vero: haha too late soldadito u know it already. 
Jose: haha now I hate you. I leave your car before it gets worse. See uu

José: I'm gonna kiss u in the cheek so don't cheat and turn around. 
Vero: haha wait not get away.
