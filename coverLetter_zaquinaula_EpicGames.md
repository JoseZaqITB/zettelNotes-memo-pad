Dear Hiring Manager
I'm eager to get involved in the game industry world, I'm recently finished a one year course about videogames and enjoy a lot all the knowledge. 

For a programmer there are different branches to specialize, webs, apps, systems, network, cyber security, videogames and perhaps others I may not know, and I feel videogames is the one for me. 

Since I was a child I was doing animations, telling stories about my friends, then showing them and  see them laugh. I had to research a lot to get to know how a animation is done, then I find pivot Animator, then trying to improve I discover Adobe flash.
Then I tried to make videogames, using the same Adobe flash and its ActionScript programming language, but it was difficult in that time for me and left it there. So once I entered in the programming world, I made very primitive games with the Linux terminal, and then try the  GUI java library call Swing with which I made a project to create a tile-base graphics game. I get excited with that project.

So now in my free time , once in a while I make animations with blender, and using more time making  games in  Unreal Engine mainly, whether it is for a jam, hackaton or just for fun.

Epic games is a big company that I really appreciate, it have made amazing videogames like Fortnite or Gears of Wars franchise and for me it's an honor to work in Epic Games.

I have good technical skills but I don't know how to make a very good videogame or how it is to be part of it or what kind of process or  methods to use. I would like to have a mentor that guides me in my first steps in the industry and learn about all the programming roles, and of course to make all the effort to make good products and support the company.

Thanks for giving me your time.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Internship Programmer position at Epic Games. As someone who has always been fascinated by the art and science of creating games, I’m eager to bring my technical skills, creativity, and enthusiasm to your incredible team. Let’s just say, making games at Epic would be a legendary achievement unlocked for me.

My love affair with creating things began as a child when I discovered the magical world of animation. Using Pivot Animator and Adobe Flash, I crafted short, silly stories about my friends, which they found utterly hilarious (or so they told me—I’m sure their laughter was entirely genuine). This sparked an insatiable curiosity about how games and animations are made, leading me to experiment with programming. During my bachelor's degree, I proudly created a tile-based game using Java’s Swing library. It wasn’t Fortnite, mind you, but it worked—and didn’t crash too often, which I considered a triumph.

Recently, I completed a one-year specialization course in video game development, where I expanded my knowledge of modern game design techniques and tools. Today, I spend much of my free time working with Unreal Engine, creating games for jams, hackathons, or just for fun. Occasionally, I even revisit my animation roots with Blender—though my characters still sometimes move like NPCs with bad pathfinding.

Epic Games has been a massive inspiration to me. Whether it’s the groundbreaking gameplay of Fortnite or the action-packed brilliance of the Gears of War franchise, your work has redefined what games can be. Joining your team would not only be a dream come true—it would probably leave me doing a celebratory emote for weeks.

While I’ve built a strong foundation in programming, I’m eager to learn more about the collaborative processes, tools, and techniques that bring AAA games to life. I’m ready to level up with the guidance of a mentor and to contribute my energy and creativity to support the team in making exceptional products.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can support Epic Games.

Sincerely,
Jose Alejandro Zaquinaula Ramón
