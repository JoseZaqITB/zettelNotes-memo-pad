Dear Hiring Manager
I'm eager to get involved in the game industry world, I'm recently finished a one year course about videogames and enjoy a lot all the knowledge. 

For a programmer there are different branches to specialize, webs, apps, systems, network, cyber security, videogames and perhaps others I may not know, and I feel videogames is the one for me. 

Since I was a child I was doing animations, telling stories about my friends, then showing them and  see them laugh. I had to research a lot to get to know how a animation is done, then I find pivot Animator, then trying to improve I discover Adobe flash.
Then I tried to make videogames, using the same Adobe flash and its ActionScript programming language, but it was difficult in that time for me and left it there. So once I entered in the programming world, I made very primitive games with the Linux terminal, and then try the  GUI java library call Swing with which I made a project to create a tile-base graphics game. I get excited with that project.

So now in my free time , once in a while I make animations with blender, and using more time making  games in  Unreal Engine mainly, whether it is for a jam, hackaton or just for fun.

Epic games is a big company that I really appreciate, it have made amazing videogames like Fortnite or Gears of Wars franchise and for me it's an honor to work in Epic Games.

I have good technical skills but I don't know how to make a very good videogame or how it is to be part of it or what kind of process or  methods to use. I would like to have a mentor that guides me in my first steps in the industry and learn about all the programming roles, and of course to make all the effort to make good products and support the company.

Thanks for giving me your time.

Certainly! Here's a playful, John Cleese-inspired version of your cover letter. Expect some dry wit and whimsical phrasing while keeping it relevant to the role:

Dear Most Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my deepest, most unbridled enthusiasm for the Internship Programmer position at Epic Games. In fact, if enthusiasm were a currency, I’d have enough to buy all the V-Bucks in the multiverse. Unfortunately, it isn’t, so here I am, hoping you’ll accept this humble letter as legal tender instead.

My love affair with creating things began as a child when I discovered the magical world of animation. Using Pivot Animator and Adobe Flash, I crafted short, silly stories about my friends, which they found utterly hilarious (or so they told me—I’m sure their laughter was entirely genuine). This sparked an insatiable curiosity about how games and animations are made, leading me to experiment with programming. During my bachelor's degree, I proudly created a tile-based game using Java’s Swing library. It wasn’t Fortnite, mind you, but it worked—and didn’t crash too often, which I considered a triumph.

More recently, I completed a one-year specialization in video game development, where I delved into modern tools and practices. These days, you’ll often find me tinkering away in Unreal Engine, creating games for jams, hackathons, or simply to satisfy my innate need to see things explode in aesthetically pleasing ways. Occasionally, I dabble in Blender animations, though I’ll admit my characters still sometimes move like they’ve had one too many cups of tea.

Now, let’s talk about Epic Games. Your titles like Fortnite and the Gears of War franchise have redefined the industry, leaving a trail of dropped jaws and sweaty palms in their wake. Joining your team would be a tremendous honor—and possibly the best excuse I’ll ever have to tell people at parties, “Yes, I work at Epic. No, I can’t get you free skins.”

While I have a strong programming foundation, I know there’s much more to learn. I’m keen to gain firsthand experience in the game development process, from scripting to collaborative workflows, all under the guidance of industry veterans. With my enthusiasm, creativity, and willingness to ask ridiculous questions (but only occasionally), I am confident I can make meaningful contributions to your team.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can support Epic Games—and, dare I say, bring just a touch of silliness and charm to the process. After all, every team could use a programmer who knows their way around a punchline as well as a punchcard.

Yours irreverently,
[Your Full Name]
