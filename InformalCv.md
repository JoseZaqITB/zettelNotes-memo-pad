- him:

 ive always been sourounded by tech, i mean, i can not hide from it.
I believe that my first contact with tech was the Computer classroom in my school, i was 9. And i was addicted to a software called Encarta. Just type some word in the searcher like "Big Lions" or "Castles" and it shows amazing pictures and even some animations. What it was most impressive was that 3D world where you were like inside that world and can walk and see in diferrent directions.

- him:

for that reason, when it turns out that i have to choose what type of subject to follow I choose Electronic devices. It was so confusing and weird but at the end I managed to understand it and kind of enjoy it.
i get a  **Electronic Bachillerato** that the equivalent in english according to google is **General Certificate Education** but specialized in Electronic.

- him:

so...i know how to make a walking robot spider with Arduino and draw some electric circuits, but how do I use it in the real world ?.

I mean, i can not just open a local an start selling drawings of basic circuits and bad walking robot spiders. or maybe yes?

Anyway, i did not sell nothing, instead i went to the University. 

[A big main building with a big "university" word in the center]

- him:

Since the beginning i get shock of all the thinks that place had, a theather, mini-cinema, enormoues libraries, big rotors, the last computers, but what impress me the most was the masive quantity of kwoledge you can get. I did not know nothing, i was ignoring everything, Maths, Physics, Estatistics, electronics, computing, biology, quimics, etc. 

But after 3 years i discover that i dont like my career. i chose electronic engineering, and when i started to see its topics i didnt like it. 

So after a long debate with myself i quit. i was gonna leave the university.

[entusiastic stickman in a boat]

The only subject i was very good was Programming, so i was gonna go to that way. But i wanna go to a country with good opportunities to increased that knowledge, i moved to Europe, to Spain.

[stickman in a computer touching keys]

I started and finished so happy, i learned what i wanted, I learned all the programming world, databases, programming languages, engines, libraries, tools, UIs, AIs, git, operating systems, etc. 
I get a diploma called "DAM" "desarrollo de aplicaciones multiplataforma" that in english is "Cross-platform application development".

That's when i started to fill my portafolio with projects.

I started to work because i needed money to specialized me in Videogames.

[stickman with a VR glasses playing games]

I discover another world, the videogaming world, it is amazing how one can be amazed every time one gets in a new subject.
engines, animations, modellig, rigging, UIs, servers, creativity...
