Dear Hiring Manager
I'm eager to get involved in the game industry world, I'm recently finished a one year course about videogames and enjoy a lot all the knowledge.

For a programmer there are different branches to specialize, webs, apps, systems, network, cyber security, videogames and perhaps others I may not know, and I feel videogames is the one for me.

Since I was a child I was doing animations, telling stories about my friends, then showing them and  see them laugh. I had to research a lot to get to know how a animation is done, then I find pivot Animator, then trying to improve I discover Adobe flash.
Then I tried to make videogames, using the same Adobe flash and its ActionScript programming language, but it was difficult in that time for me and left it there. So once I entered in the programming world, I made very primitive games with the Linux terminal, and then try the  GUI java library call Swing with which I made a project to create a tile-base graphics game. I get excited with that project.

So now in my free time , once in a while I make animations with blender, and using more time making  games in  Unreal Engine and Unity, whether it is for a jam, hackaton or just for fun.

Rare is a big company that I really appreciate, it have made amazing videogames like donkey Kong ( who makes me have great times with my cousin ) or Everwild and for me it's an honor to work in Epic Games.

I have good technical skills but I don't know how to make a very good videogame or how it is to be part of it or what kind of process or  methods to use. I would like to have a mentor that guides me in my first steps in the industry and learn about all the programming roles, and of course to make all the effort to make good products and support the company.

Thanks for giving me your time.
